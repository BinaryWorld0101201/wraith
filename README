Wraith is an IRC bot written in C++. It has been in development since late 2003. 
It is based on Eggdrop 1.6.12 but has since evolved into something much different at its core.

Wraith aims to be a secure and easy to setup and manage botnet. 
A botnet can be setup in a matter of minutes and updated later with 1 command. 
Leaf bots save no files locally, but rather store configuration in their own binary. 
Hubs do not connect to IRC, and keep a local encrypted copy of the userfile.

All official documentation and releases can be found on the site.
