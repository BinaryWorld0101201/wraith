 Rewrote update system once again, seems to be working flawlessly now.
	-Binaries are no longer compressed on send, use upx for linux binaries.

          -Just ftp the new binary, and use .botupdate
 Added cmds: botupdate, botkill, net/botcrontab
 Removed cmd_rehash; cmd_restart does nothing for now.
 Fixed +take
 +bitch is enforced by every bot as of now, will be fixed to be like +take later..
 Added ctcp cloaking
 All kicks are cloaked correctly now

 Renamed cmd_mtcl to cmd_nettcl
 Cmds requiring +a no longer require perm owner status, reasoning: only a perm owner can give +a, so make sure you trust that user...

 cmd_op reverted to op a nick even if already opped. (could fix a desync)
 Fixed a cosmetic bug in cmd_help
